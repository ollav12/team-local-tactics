## Objective
The purpose of this assigment is to build an architecture that transforms the local game "Team Local Tactics" to an distributed application that allows for online play between several clients.

## How to play
1. Start the server
2. Start the client twice (so that you have two clients open at once)
3. You can now play the game, if you want to play again you will have to reopen the server and client
4. After the game you can open the match_history.txt to see your past games saved there
5. You can also change champions.txt stats. Changing them wont affect people who are in a game that has started.
